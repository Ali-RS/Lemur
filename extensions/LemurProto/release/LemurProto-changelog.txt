-------------
-Added Action and ActionButton for having a more general
    way of passing around "actions" that can be reused in
    various buttons.  Eventually this gets expanded into
    toolbar buttons, menu buttons, etc.
-Added an OptionPanel similar to Swing's JOptionPane.  It
    can be used to present a message or simple set of
    options to the user.
