Lemur TBD
---------
* Updated Panel javadoc to clartify y-inversion in layouts.
* Added a ConsumingMouseListener implementation that can be
    used to make GUI elements "opaque" to mouse events.
* Added TextField.setFont().
* TextComponent and TextEntryComponent will no longer recreate
    the BitmapText in setFont() unless the font has actually
    changed.
