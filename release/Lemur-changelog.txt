Lemur TBD
---------
* Updated Panel javadoc to clartify y-inversion in layouts.
* Added a ConsumingMouseListener implementation that can be
    used to make GUI elements "opaque" to mouse events.
* Added TextField.setFont().
* TextComponent and TextEntryComponent will no longer recreate
    the BitmapText in setFont() unless the font has actually
    changed.
* QuadBackgroundComponent modified to support Textures.
* Added a HoverMouseListener to better facility fly-over style
    tool tips.
* Added the ElementId to the toString() of the core GUI elements.
* MouseAppState modified to do picking on the collision roots in
    reverse order so that they better act like layers.
* Added convenience methods to ElementId to grab a child element
    ID using the dot-notation preferred by the style system.
* Added standard get() method to Attributes that looks up the
    value without doing a default value check (which requires knowing
    the type).
* Add the ability to retrieve the command lists from a button.
